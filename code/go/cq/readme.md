# Golang CQRS templates

## Description

This is a set of templates to generate code for a CQRS pattern in Golang.

There are a few benefits of using the CQRS pattern, but the main benefit is that it separates the read and write operations. This means that you can optimize the read and write operations separately. This is especially useful when you have a lot of read operations and a few write operations.
